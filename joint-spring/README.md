# Joint Spring Constant

The joint spring constant defines how much force the spring exerts per unit of distance from the spring's equilibrium state (the state where it is neither compressed nor stretched).

The force balance equation:

$$
F=m\ddot{x}+b\dot{x}+kx
$$

where $F$ is an applied force, x is position, $\dot{x}$ is velocity, and $\ddot{x}$ is acceleration. $m$ is mass, $k$ is a spring constant, and $b$ is a viscous damping term.
